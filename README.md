# RANT 

### *A app that lets you review restaurants on more then just the overall experience.*

We all know that feeling of being hungry and not knowing where to go so we google/yelp places to eat. You're feeling adventurous so you choose a 3 star place...**YES A 3 STAR ESTABLISHMENT**. Why though? Why is this place middle of the pack? Sure you can go through the various reviews and read a 1 star review and have read someone *rant* about how their one off experience absolutely suuuuucked cause the wait staff was rude to them. Okay you know that the wait staff is rude but what about the food? Now you have to source another review. All this time you're getting more and more hungry. 

That is where **RANT** comes to the rescue! With RANT you get more then just one overall review.  Here we understand that you people are different...so we make it so that you can see different ratings for different parts of the whole restaurant experience. Those parts being: Overall, wait time, wait staff, instagram worthiness, taste,bathroom cleanliness. All of that upfront. If you're in the mood for American food, your're not just in the mood for American food.  You're **really** in the mood for good american food with a reasonalbe wait staff and your day wasn't the greatest so you're looking for a 5 star wait time.
